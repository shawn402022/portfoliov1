                    My name is Shawn, hailing from Jersey City,NJ. In 2000 I went to school for computer science, the program was not as robust back then so I grew bored my first semester. I  switched majors to media arts with a concentration in audio engineering, and after graduating  I did a brief stint  at Electric lady studios in Nyc. I then started producing music and got some good placements under my belt. I didn't have the best experience's in that industry but it remains a side hustle for me.  In 2012 I became obsessed with animation, and wanted to work at Disney, so I  taught myself until I got an opportunity to polish my skills at Berkeley College. Although the degree I pursued  was in interior design, I knew the programs used were similar( in most cases the same) to the programs used for animation. Unfortunately my financial aide was exhausted but luckily that did not matter. Even though I was not able to finish the program, my skills were refined, and I was able to put together a nice portfolio  which you can see here  http://shawnnorbert.crevado.com/ . Interior design was not my thing exactly but I was able to render hi end designs for interiors so In my mind I was on my way to becoming an animator as a renderer or modeler. I made a plan! I just had to self teach again right?    Not exactly. I tried to take some classes at Anim School, and soon discovered that animation is not necessarily what I wanted to do. I liked the finished product but I didn't really enjoy the process which is very important. I did take a liking to 'Technical Directing' though ( more on that later)  At this point it was 2016 and I met a young lady who would eventually become my wife.  in 2018 I  got a job with Tiffany's and Co. The pay was wonderful, not to mention the fact I was able to support a family! Then some hard ships came at us with Covid and my wife lost her job, Tiffany and Co would get bought out by LVMH and the lay offs began.  On February 2nd, 2022, I got 2 sets of news.  The first set was that I was having Twins which was very exciting,  the second set of news was that I was being laid off.  At this point I had a 1 year old daughter and a 2 year old son and my wife still wasn't working so I was beyond stressed  and things were a little shaky. In May 2022 I was able to get a job with a nice company called "I Crave NYC"  doing the same work I was doing at Tiffany's and Co.   It was at  Icrave that I realized I don't want to do design anymore and in fact I never wanted to do design. I was using it as a means to an end, but that end was no longer interesting to me.  I found myself in a strange situation. I had a great job making even more than I did at Tiffanies and Co,  but I didn't feel like I belonged there.  I don't know if I self sabotaged or if God was trying to tell me something but, a made a really costly mistake at Icrave and by July I found myself without work again. At this point I knew I never wanted to work in design again, at least not in the capacity I was working in before. One day I was looking through my book collection and I found two very interesting books I had forgotten about. They were two volumes " programming for animators vol 1 &2"  I had gotten them because I was looking at the technical director program at Anim School.. A technical director or "TD" is a programmer that creates tools for animation houses.  he/she basically streamlines the production pipeline.  I was interested but wasnt able toattended the school for that particular program the timing was just not good. Instead I looked up what books they use for their curriculum and bought them. The books were filled with highlighted sentences and paragraphs, and I remembered how interested I was. It was a way to work in animation but through a process that I enjoyed.   I think I stopped reading the books because I had questions that couldn't be answered,  questions that I didn't even know how to word. The guidance wasn't there. It's approaching August. Im on my phone and I see a ad for Coding Temple and it says its a coding boot camp. Coincidentally I was on the phone with a family member who is a programmer for Facebook.  Before I got off the phone with him I told him I wanted to make a career pivot and do what he's doing. I asked him how can I get into it.  He then told me that I should try to find a good coding bootcamp. The rest is history. I'm taking this course so that I can gain the skills needed to be a Technical Director, as well as open other opportunities  that I would not have otherwise.
